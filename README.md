### 📊 Credit Risk Modelling — Logistic Regression vs XGBoost Strategy
A full **credit risk prediction and lending strategy optimization system** designed to estimate loan default probability and simulate profit-driven approval decisions.

This project goes beyond modelling and mirrors real-world banking analytics.

**Project Highlights**
- Outlier detection and realistic borrower filtering
- Missing value handling and feature scaling
- Logistic Regression (interpretable baseline)
- XGBoost (advanced nonlinear model)
- Class imbalance handling
- Feature importance analysis
- Probability threshold optimisation
- Business simulation for profit maximization

**Business Impact:**  
Transforms ML predictions into **financial decision strategy**, optimizing loan approvals for maximum portfolio profitability rather than model accuracy alone.
